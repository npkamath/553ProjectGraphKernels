1. Preprocessing & PhysicsNOISE_THRESHOLD (Default: 0.3)What it does: Any simulation with noise greater than this value is automatically forced to the label 'Disordered'.Impact: If your model is confusing noisy Crystals with Disordered particles, lower this (e.g., to 0.1) to make the definition of "Crystal" stricter. If you want the model to be robust to messiness, increase it.NEIGHBOR_RADIUS (Default: 1)What it does: Determines how "deep" the ego graph goes. 1 means we only grab immediate neighbors. 2 grabs neighbors of neighbors.Impact: Increasing this to 2 gives the kernel more structural information but significantly slows down training. 1 is usually sufficient for crystal structures (FCC/BCC).N_BINS (Default: 20)What it does: We convert the continuous Minkowski floats ($M_4 \dots M_{12}$) into discrete integer categories (bins).Impact:Lower (e.g., 5-10): Makes the model "blurrier" and more tolerant of noise. Use this if accuracy is low because identical crystals look slightly different.Higher (e.g., 50): Makes the model extremely precise. Use this if the model cannot distinguish between very similar structures (like FCC vs HCP).2. Sampling & PerformanceSAMPLES_PER_GRAPH (Default: 30)What it does: We randomly pick this many nodes from each large simulation to create our training set.Impact:Increase (e.g., 100): More training data, potentially higher accuracy, but much slower kernel computation (time scales quadratically).Decrease (e.g., 10): Very fast training, good for quick debugging.N_JOBS (Default: -1)What it does: Controls how many CPU cores GraKeL uses. -1 means "Use All Cores." Always keep this at -1 unless you are running other heavy tasks in the background.3. Model & KernelKERNEL_TYPE (Default: 'WL-OA')Options: 'WL-OA' (Optimal Assignment) or 'WL' (Subtree).Impact: 'WL-OA' is more accurate but slower. 'WL' is very fast but might miss subtle geometric matches.WL_ITERATIONS (Default: 4)What it does: The "depth" of the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm. It determines how many hops away the kernel looks to compare nodes.Impact: For crystals, 4 or 5 is usually the sweet spot.SVM_C (Default: 10.0)What it does: Regularization for the SVM classifier.Impact:High (100+): Strict decision boundary. Good if you have clean data.Low (0.1 - 1.0): Soft boundary. Better if your data is very noisy and you want to prevent overfitting.
